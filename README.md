## Discontinued

Unfortunately, development of mon.icu project has eventually became more of a burden to me
than something I like doing. I hope to take a rest from it, and come back to it some day.

I won't shut down the project, I just won't continue working on it, as so far it proved to
be sturdy and error-prone, with maintainability and stability I'm fine with as of now.

This repository will remain open and unarchived, everyone is still welcome to check it out
and add soemthing to it if they like. Cheers, your dreamscached.
